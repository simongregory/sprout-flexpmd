# The FlexPMD Sprout Gem

This [RubyGem](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/book/7) contains a rake task to add support for [FlexPMD](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexpmd/FlexPMD) in [Project Sprouts](http://projectsprouts.org).

Functionality is only tested on OSX, it is *not expected* to work on Windows. You may be ok on Linux.

## Install

    git clone [this repo]
    cd sprout-flexpmd
    bundle install
    gem build flexpmd.gemspec 
    gem install flexpmd
    
#### Or

    gem install flexpmd

## Usage

Add the following to your rake file

    desc "Use FlexPMD to audit source code"
    flexpmd 'report/pmd' do |t|
      t.src = 'src'
    end

    desc "Use FlexCPD to detect copy pasted code"
    flexcpd 'report/cpd.xml' do |t|
      t.src = 'src'
      t.minimum_tokens = 50
    end

    desc "Use FlexMetrics to generate code metrics for this project"
    flexmetrics 'report/metrics.xml' do |t|
      t.src = 'src'
    end

    task :audit => ['report/pmd', 'report/cpd.xml', 'report/metrics.xml']
    
Then invoke it with

    rake audit
    
Output can be found in the `report/` directory created in the project root. This is best consumed via the relevant [Jenkins|http://jenkins-ci.org/] plugins.
